## Introduction

Welcome to GenshinFigures, It's like a pokemon experience, but for your Discord server... with Genshin Impact characters & enemies! Isn't that so cool?!

You can join our [server](https://discord.gg/uBpfj8xntn) and invite the bot from [this link.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1245404526727528469)

## Getting Started with GenshinFigures

### Required Stuff

- Dowload Docker: <https://hub.docker.com/>
- Download Git: <https://git-scm.com/>

### Installation

1. Fork this repository (Go to my profile, find the repository called GenshinFigures and press the "fork" button in the top right).
2. Git clone the new project (open any command prompt, and copy paste this command: git clone <https://github.com/QueenTheDarkner/GenshinFigures>).

### Accessing The Bot And The Admin Panel

Once you've completed the installation and configuration steps, GenshinFigures will be up and running within the Docker environment. You can now access and interact with the bot on your Discord server!

Go to <http://localhost:8000/> to make changes to your bot! Make sure **Docker is running while you access the website.**

- Before going to the first link above, go to <http://localhost:8000/admin/init> to create your first user, then login. Use the account you just created, and continue with the first link.

- You will be disconnected after some time (for security reasons). When this happens, you'll be seeing a bunch of 401 errors popping up. To fix this, click the empty profile picture at the top right corner, then click logout.

That's it! Don't forget to create new collectibles and special events within your new bot! You're all set to explore the world of catching within GenshinFigures using Docker and Docker Compose on Windows, macOS, and Linux. If you run into any trouble along the way, don't hesitate to reach out for help. We're here to make sure you have a smooth ride using our service! ;D

## Contribution to GenshinFigures

Here's how you can jump in and help make this project even better:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b new-feature`.
3. Make your changes and commit them with cool and descriptive messages: `git commit -m 'Add new feature'`.
4. Push your changes to your branch: `git push origin new-feature`.
5. Open a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch of the original repository.

### Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

To make sure your PR can be checked out and merged smoothly, please follow these guidelines:

- Clearly describe the purpose of the PR and the changes made.
- Provide tests and documentation for any new features or changes in functionality.
- If possible, include screenshots showing before/after states of any visual changes.
- Ensure that all existing tests pass without failure.
- Make sure your code follows the project's coding standards and vibes.

### Pull Request (PR) Notes

## What's Likely To Get Accepted

- **Small PR's (if they focus on a single topic).** A good PR is about 20-40 lines of code.
- **Simple PR's.** If you choose something easy that we can do, chances are you'll see the feature you mentioned in action is pretty high!

## What's Not Likely To Get Accepted

- **Large PR's (if they focus on multiple topics).** It is really time consuming for us to do 100-200 lines of code in a single PR.
- **Complex PR's (if they focus on multiple topics WITH fundamental changes).** Please be empathetic and think about how time-consuming and tiring it will be for us to write more than 200 codes in a single PR, sorry!
- **Chaotic PR's.** It's really better to keep the PR concise and focused on the bot itself.
- **Stale PR's,** if they have been open for a long time and have not been merged, or if they have not been reviewed by the maintainers, reviewers, or community members, for reasons including no activity or no feedback.

### Code of Conduct

We're all about creating a welcoming and chill community!
Everyone who contributes is expected to stick to the [Code of Conduct](./assets/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when getting involved with the project and its community members. Thank you!
